    "# Intuition arround the approach :\n",
    "### problem at hand : Given an integer array nums, we need to determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums.\n",
    "### as firstly we should find the total_sum of numbers in an given array\n",
    "### If the total sum of the array is Odd, return false since it cannot be split into two equal integer sums.  //this will be major-case to return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### if the total sum of numbers is Even then we're all set to partition the array into two subsets with equal sum\n",
    "### so for forming one of the above two equal sum subset , We should determine the target_sum that will be half of the total_sum of numbers in an given array \n",
    "\n",
    "### for example if given array is  nums = [1,5,11,5]  ; so its total_sum = 22 ; so target_sum of both subsets will be : total_sum//2 = 22//2 = 11 ; so target_sum = 11 \n",
    "### it means if we able to ahcieve target-sum = 11 while building one of the subset then we will return True for given array ; and that will be the solution to problem at hand  \n",

    "# Recursion-approach (recursion-tree to vaisulaize the above intuition)\n",
    "### we will go recursively from from index 0 to upto the index of last number in the array \n",
    "\n",
    "### for each number on succesive index we have two choices either exclude the numbers or include the number \n",
    "### when we exclude the number target_sum reamined same and we will move to the next index \n",
    "### when we include the number taeget_sum will be reduced by number and we will move to the next index  \n",
    "\n",
    "### we will do this inclusion exclusion procedures with each and every number \n",
    "### and check whether in inclusuion-branch or exclusion branch we achieved our total-sum or not \n",

    "### while going through branches of inclusion and exclusion if our target-sum = 0 then return true //as we found one of the subset with sum equals to target-sum  [base case] \n",

    "### while going through branches of inclusion and exclusion if our target-sum = -ve(or less than zero) then return false //as this means while going through branches we can't achieve sum equals to target-sum   [base-case]\n",
